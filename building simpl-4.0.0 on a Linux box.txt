Building simpl-4.0.0 on a Linux box
===================================

Installation
------------

Install the simpl-4.0.0.tar.bz2 tarball in the desired directory, say /home/development for example. Note > is the command line prompt in the following.

Now you have /home/development/simpl-4.0.0.tar.bz2

> cd /home/development

>bunzip2 simpl-4.0.0.tar.bz2

Now you should have /home/development/simpl-4.0.0.tar

>tar -xvf simpl-4.0.0.tar

Now you should have a directory /home/development/simpl-4.0.0

>cd simpl-4.0.0

You are now in the top level simpl-4.0.0 directory.

>make clean
>make all

Top level Makefile will run all lower level make files and creates the simpl-4.0.0 software tree.

Environment Variables
---------------------

For simpl python to work properly the PYTHONPATH environment variable must be set as follows: (using the path to simpl-4.0.0 as /home/development/ as above)

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/development/simpl-4.0.0/pymodules

For simpl dynamically linked libraries in C and C++ the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must be set as follows:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/development/simpl-4.0.0/dynamic-lib

It is recommended that these environment variables be set either in the /etc/profile file or the /home/username/.profile file. The first case applies to all users and the second case to the one user alone.
