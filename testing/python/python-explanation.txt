AUTHOR:			John Collins
********************************************************************************

This text file describes the testing programs for SIM-Python. These testing programs attempt to test all of the available tools for sending/receiving SIM messages within Python. Python 3 is the only supported version; earlier versions have been dropped by the SIM programme.

/.../testing /python contains the following directories:

./bin which contains C++ exectuables receiver and sender.
./C++ which contains the C++ source code for the executables receiver and sender.
./Py which contains the python test scripts.
./scripts which contains shell scripts that automate the python and binary test programs.
