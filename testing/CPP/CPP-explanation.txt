DESCRIPTION:	A short description of the SIM C++ test program arangements.

AUTHOR:			John Collins
********************************************************************************

The test programs are segregated to several directories:
1. local,
2. loopback-TCP-network,
3. TCP-network,
4. RS232-network.

One of the reasons for this segregation is that the networked-based programs are somewhat more extensive "under the hood" than the local. Since this is the case, the network based-programs actually test more aspects of SIM than their locally-based cousins. By locally-based it is meant that the senders and receivers are both running on the same host computer. The loopback-TCP-network uses TCP/IP, but again the senders and receivers reside on the same computer host. The TCP-network and RS232-network programs must be run on at least 2 different host computers.
