DESCRIPTION:	A short description of the SIM C test program scripts.

AUTHOR:			John Collins
********************************************************************************

This text file contains descriptions of the python scripts used for testing. They are listed in alphabetical order. All scripts are Python 3 compatible only. The purpose of the scripts is to automate the testing by starting and stopping the various test program senders and receivers.

The scripts are run from the command line. Assume that the command line prompt is > for these descriptions.

NOTE: All of these scripts are equipped to run a number of concurrent SIM-enabled programs. The number is entered on the command line and can literally be anything. By entering a number that is too large you can 'overwhelm' the operating system. This can be a good test for finding out the limitations of a system and thus preventing problems.

sen-poll.py
===========

This script runs a number of concurrent sender and polling receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 sen-poll.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent send/poll pairs of SIM programs to be run.

sen-rec.py
==========

This script runs a number of concurrent sender and receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 sen-rec.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent send/receive pairs of SIM programs to be run.

sen-relay-rec.py
================

This script runs a number of concurrent sender, receiver/relay and receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 sen-relay-rec.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent send/relay/receive triples of SIM programs to be run.

sen-select.py
=============

This script runs a number of concurrent senders and selecting receivers.

Its run by:

>python3 sen-select.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent send/select pairs of SIM programs to be run.

sen-senrec-rec.py
=================

This script runs a number of concurrent sender, sender/receiver and receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 sen-senrec-rec.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent send/sender-receiver/receive triples of SIM programs to be run.

trig-poll.py
============

This script runs a number of concurrent trigger and polling receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 trig-poll.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent trigger/poll pairs of SIM programs to be run.

trig-rec.py
===========

This script runs a number of concurrent trigger and receiver programs.

Its run by:

>python3 trig-rec.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent trigger/receive pairs of SIM programs to be run.

trig-select.py
==============

This script runs a number of concurrent triggers and selecting receivers.

Its run by:

>python3 trig-select.py #

where "#" is the number of concurrent trigger/select pairs of SIM programs to be run.
